FINAL PROJECT
====

### DUE: FRIDAY, DECEMBER 21

Your final project for the semester is to make something, anything, using at least one of the tools covered in class this semester. The choice of what you'll make and what format it's output will be (screen, interactive, printed, projected) are up to you. Whatever you decide, it should be an ambitious project that is worthy of four weeks' of work, and that pushes your artistic, creative, and technical skills. Feel free to involve non-computational media (drawing, photography, illustration, music) if you want alongside or with your code.

The goal should be a project that you're personally invested in, and that you procrastinate all other projects to work on!

### PROJECT CALENDAR  
**Nov 16:** Final project assigned, work on your concept statement and rough prototypes.
**Nov 24:** Due for rough concept statements and mindmaps
**Nov 30:** Tuba out of town, no class! Continue working on projects.
**Dec 7:** Rough prototypes due, demos of work in progress and work day
**Dec 21:** Final projects due uploaded to Canvas and Tumblr with the process documentation.

### FOR SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 24
Please upload your brainstorming process (photos) and concept statements into the drive folder below by Nov 24th. Saturday. You should create a personal folder with your name and surname (ex: TubaOzkan) and put everything related with your concept into this folder. You can also add inspirational images+video links etc. supporting your concept.

### FOR FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 30
Please re-write your final concept statements based on the feedback you have recieved.

**TROUBLE COMING UP WITH IDEAS?**  
This project is all yours. It should come from your passions. As a jumping off point, think about things you've enjoyed doing this semester, and things that you're generally obsessed with. If you love binge-watching crappy 80s TV, maybe a project that manipulates or analyzes millions of frames of video from those shows. If you are super into language, maybe a poem-generating sketch that outputs printable book PDFs with auto-generated illustrations.

There are some techniques you can use:

1- Create “mind maps” of all concepts come to your mind relating to your interests, passions, etc. The purpose of mind maps is putting your thoughts on the paper/board and organize them. Another good way of brainstorming is sketching. Don't hesitate to use post-its and don't forget to take photos of your brainstorming process! For samples, review the mindmaps part in the pdf for Week 12 (https://github.com/ozkantuba/CreativeProgrammingI/blob/master/Lectures/Week%2012.pdf).

2- Once you organize your thoughts, try to place them in a concept statement format. Your concept statement should give answers to these core questions: Who are you designing for, or who are your audiences? What is this project about, why? How do you realize your idea? Etc. Review the concept statement patterns in the pdf.

3- Plan ahead, start searching for the technical difficulties you might face. Make the research about the possible solutions. If you can not come up with any solution after spending a decent amount of energy and time, ask me for guidance.

I'll give you written feedback on your proposals, though **we won't have class the week of Nov 30.** Please also start working on your projects over the Thanskgiving break – you'll have a rough prototype due December 7.

### FOR FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7    
You should have already started working on your final project, and this week you should bring a rough prototype. It doesn't need to all be working, but should be far enough along for us to give feedback without a ton of explanation: "show, not tell." We'll do quick feedback sessions and have some work time. Note this is our last week to talk, so bring code questions and things you need help with.

### FOR FRIDAY, DECEMBER 21
**Note that this is an online turn-in only! We won't have an in-person crit of your projects.** There are a few things you need to do to turn these in, so please read this carefully.

**PROJECT FILES**  
Project files should be in a folder, titled `LastnameFirstname_FinalProject`, and uploaded to Canvas.

**DOCUMENTATION IN THE TUMBLR**
You should update your proposal's Tumblr page to document the finished project:
This documentation is what I'll primarily use to grade your projects, so please take your time like you would with a project report or paper.
