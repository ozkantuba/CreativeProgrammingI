FINAL PROJECT
====

### DUE: FRIDAY, DECEMBER 21

Your final project for the semester is to make something, anything, using at least one of the tools covered in class this semester. The choice of what you'll make and what format it's output will be (screen, interactive, printed, projected) are up to you. Whatever you decide, it should be an ambitious project that is worthy of four weeks' of work, and that pushes your artistic, creative, and technical skills. Feel free to involve non-computational media (drawing, photography, illustration, music) if you want alongside or with your code.

The goal should be a project that you're personally invested in, and that you procrastinate all other projects to work on!

### PROJECT CALENDAR  
**Nov 16:** Final project assigned, work on your concept statement and rough prototypes.
**Nov 24:** Due for rough concept statements and mindmaps
**Nov 30:** Tuba out of town, no class! Continue working on projects.
**Dec 7:** Rough prototypes due, demos of work in progress and work day
**Dec 21:** Final projects due uploaded to Canvas and Tumblr with the process documentation. We will meet online to hear everybody's presentations.

### FOR FRIDAY, DECEMBER 21
**There will be an online turn-in and we will meet online through Google Hangsout to listen everybody's presentations!** Further details will be shared about online meeting.

**PROJECT DELIVERABLES**
1- Your working code
2- Presentation Deck
3- A 30-50 seconds video shows the interaction between your project and your target audience. Think this video like a short clip that shows the ideal usage/interaction scenario that you imagined for your project. As an example: if your project supposed to be a projected installation that people interact within a gallery setting or in a public space, try to mimic that experience in the video. Find creative ways to capture this video: you can use projectors or bigger screens and your roommates as actors/actresses.

**WHAT TO UPLOAD TO THE CANVAS?**
You should upload all deliverables mentioned above. Project files should be in a folder, titled `LastnameFirstname_FinalProject`, and uploaded to Canvas.

**WHAT TO UPLOAD TO THE TUMBLR**
Your concept statement and your short videos should be uploaded to the tumblr.



FINAL PRESENTATION
====

In most cases, presenting your work is as much important as your work itself! Even though the basic final form of your projects will be a processing code, while presenting our work to others, we usually need to talk about other details including our concept, process, and inspiration before showing the outcome.

For our online meeting, you are expected to prepare an 8-10 slides presentation. The main principle for your presentations should be "no/min text + max visuals". These slides are not for you to read from, they are for your audience. For providing visual support to people to help them to comprehend the spoken language. The following should be the flow of your presentations:

    1- Domain of interests - Your mind maps+ sketches is an excellent way to start talking about your projects.
    2- What are your inspirations? - Show 1-2 sample projects that you got inspiration from for your projects.
    3- What is your concept statement? - Your statement is something like a descriptive info card next to the artworks in gallery settings. It should be 2-3 sentences, explaining what is your project (exp: I am designing an AI-powered wearable named as Third Eye), what it does (exp: analyzes how much time each day its user spends by staring at a screen), how it works (exp: when the wearer looks at or interacts with a screen, Third Eye detects the interaction and stores those moments as images in the cloud).
    4- Show your process - screen recordings of your early prototypes, mention the problems (conceptual or coding problems) you had, how did you overcome the struggles you face to face through the process? What did you learn from your process?
    5- Show your short demo video in one slide. (KILLER SLIDE)
    6- One slide about the future of this project. If you continue to this project, what would you improve?

Some Concept Statement Examples:

"I am designing an AI-powered wearable,a Third Eye, that analyzes how much time each day its user spends by staring at a screen. When the wearer looks at or interacts with a screen, Third Eye detects the interaction and stores those moments as images in the cloud."

"This project visualizes the exact physical location* of every byte on my laptop’s hard drive. Using digital forensics software, similar to that used by law enforcement, the locations were extracted and drawn not as useful data visualizations but instead a sublime, unknowable self portrait. Presented as 11 large inkjet-printed panels, each individual byte remains visible – dark gray squares indicates data written to the drive, light gray areas with no data. The scale of these tiny squares was carefully calibrated to the inkjet printer and hovers at the edge of the printer’s resolution."

"WonderLandAR is a set of interactive experience that helps children patients in dealing with hospital phobia during their hospital journey. It transforms the hospitals and local clinics into interactive and playful environments by using AR and AI technology."
