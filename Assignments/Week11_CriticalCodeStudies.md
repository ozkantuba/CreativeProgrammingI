CRITICAL CODE STUDIES + PARTICLE SYSTEMS
====

### DUE: FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 16

Please read the excerpt from *10 PRINT CHR$*, found in the `Readings` folder. We'll talk about Critical Code Studies and analyzing code. Write up two responses, questions, or provocations and post them as an issue on this repository under the title `Firstname Lastname: 10 PRINT CHR$`. (Optionally, also check out the amazing collection *Software Studies: A Lexicon*, also in the `Readings` folder.)

+++

In Github, Code Folder you will find sample codes about particle systems. Go over all of them and play around with "Systems of System" sample. Change one or two things in the code, and observe the results.

The primary goal of this exercise is understanding the code structure for defining classes, and creating objects that belong to the classes you have identified.

Try to understand what you have changed, is it a variable, or is it a function? Is it a feature/function of an object? If so, which class does this object belong?

If you get errors, try to understand them. Double check the feature you have changed, is it a feature also related to another class?  In the systems of system sample, there are two classes defined; one is using the objects defined by the other class. How does the relationship between one class and the other structured?


### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project will be graded with the following rubric:

**10%:** Project meets technical requirements (correct file format, naming convention, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows creativity, attention to visual quality (composition, color, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows clear use of technical material covered in class  
**30%:** Project shows investigation and exploration of assignment topic
